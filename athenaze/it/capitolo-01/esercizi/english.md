# Capitolo 01

What Greek words from the story at the beginning of this chapter do you recognize in the following English words? Define the words, using your knowledge of the Greek.

1. anthropology - **ὁ ἃνθρωπος** (the study of mankind)
1. polysyllabic - **πολύς** (a word of many syllables)
1. philosophy - **φιλεῖ** (love of wisdom)
1. microscope - **μῑκρός** (an instrument for oberserving small things)

---

English Greekisms are very often compounds, that is, they derive from the union of two, or sometimes even more than two, elements: for example, the word _philantropy_ is composed of a first element fil(o)- (the same as philosophy), meaning "friend, lover (of)," and of ἄνθρωπος, so that it means "the being a friend of humans, love for humans."
Of these compounds, several already existed in Greek, but a great many were coined after the end of antiquity by scholars, always drawing on terms from ancient Greek.
In which of the four words above (which are actually compounds) do you recognize derivatives of the following Greek words?

1. σκοπεῖ, "look, observe" - **microscope**
1. σοφίᾱ, "wisdom" - **philosophy**
1. λόγος, "word, speech, discourse" - **anthropology**
